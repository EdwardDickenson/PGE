# Primitive Graphics Engine

Just a basic graphics engine written in C++ using OpenGL, SOIL, and GLFW. It is only capable of rendering geometric primitives such as circles and squares. At the moment
there is only support for Linux and there are no plans to change this in the immediate future.  This software does not have any "official" support and anyone using this for
any purpose does so at their own risk.
