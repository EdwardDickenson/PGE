# Primitive Graphics Engine

Just a basic graphics/game engine written in C++ using OpenGL, SOIL, and GLFW. Presently this software is only capable
of rendering geometric primitives such as rectangles and squares, more features are planned but are not
currently implemented.

This software does not have any "official" support and anyone using this for any purpose does so at their own risk.

Presently capable of rendering:
* Squares
* Circles

Requirements:
* C++0x compiler
* OpenGL/Mesa
* GLFW
* SOIL
